This python program was an exercise I coded for the "Complete Python-3 Bootcamp" class on Udemy. 

It uses webscraping techniques to connect to http://quotes.toscrape.com/ and webscrape it to get:
- unique list of authors
- list of all the quotes
- list of the top ten tags

The program scrapes each page of the site and then prints all of the data.
